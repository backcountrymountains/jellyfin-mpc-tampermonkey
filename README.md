Tampermonkey scripts to use MPC with Jellyfin

The script using fetch works for me. 

Note: I had to do a PR on MPC to update the headers and allow CORS requests. The PR has been merged, but the script probably won't be able to update Jellyfin with MPC progress until the merged version of MPC is released.

Or you can compile it from my MPC repository.

I have no idea how any of this stuff works or what I'm doing.
